# vue-ask

## Install & run
1. `git clone https://github.com/mregulski/vue-ask.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` (uses port 8080)

## Technologies used:
* Vue.js - because I'm familiar with it, and it introduces relatively small complexity overhead while making e.g templating fast & simple. Also because I wanted to use it more extensively than I had an opportunity to before.
* webpack - because I wanted to use Vue's single-file components to see how are they to work with
* for views: basic HTML and CSS, with some SCSS sugar on top of it for keeping tabs on colors, some common sizez, etc. Decided not to use any HTML templating language, because Vue already handles templating, and simplified syntax would be just unnecessary layer of sugar.
* also decided against css frameworks, because I felt like it would be a bit of overkill for the project of this size, especially considering that most things would have to be adjusted manually anyway
